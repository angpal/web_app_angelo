  	<p>AllStyle Homes custom built green homes offer many unique benefits to you as the buyer. These benefits are both tangible and intangible, but together equal uncompromising quality and unprecedented value. Not only are AllStyle Homes custom designed, architecturally appealing and finished with excellent materials, they are soundly built from the ground up. Your AllStyle Homes custom built home will be structurally and asthetically superior than every home in your neighbourhood. In fact, your neighbours will say, ”We wish we would have built with AllStyle Homes!”</p>
    
	<p class="faqquestions">What makes AllStyle Homes Different?</p>
	<p class="txtindent">Our homes are built to a much higher standard stipulated by Australian Standard. The process that we use is completely open and transparent and we build every home like it is ours.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">How Does the Financing Work?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">You can use your own lender, or we can refer you to one who is familiar with AllStyle Homes. All we require is a deposit of 10%, preferably at the signing of the contract. If this is not possible, you should be aware that no work can commence on the site until the deposit is received.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">How long does the Building Process Take?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">As you can see from the homes featured on our website we build homes that are custom designed according to each client’s specific taste. Since each home is unique it can take up to 60 days to design the home, and then allow 21 days for the financing process. The building process generally takes 4 to 6 months to complete.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">Can You Help Locate a Block of Land?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">This is always the first step in building a new home. Yes we can certainly help point you in the right direction in finding a block on which to build. This said, we always point out from the start that we are not a Real Estate Agent or land developer. We are solely a building/construction company.</p><br>
    
    <p class="txtindent">We have an affiliated real estate agent licensed to search for and secure available lots, and we are also connected with land developers for access to other lots that may not be listed.</p>
    
	<p class="txtindent">Whether you choose utilise our affiliated company or to go through your own real estate agent, we just ask that we are involved in the process so we can design your home to maximise the size and location/orientation of the block you are considering.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">What is the Design Process?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">We use a unique design process that allows our clients to be part of every decision from the very beginning. This allows us to implement any necessary adjustments in order to stay on time and on budget for the project, making the building process as stress free as possible for our clients.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">Do I Go to Home Improvement Stores to Pick Everything Out?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">Our interior designers will help keep you on budget with a worry-free process. Let our professionals do the shopping for you. All you have to do is come to our office and tell them your preferences.
Our on staff interior designers will assist you in finding the best options for your home at no additional charge.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">How Do You Handle Changes to the Order?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">Our design process is structured to help limit the frequency of changes by highly involving the client in every decision in order to prevent cost-overrun. 
In the event that a change is requested, the change will be fully discussed, including all structural (architectural) and financial implications. A signed addendum to the original contract must be completed before alteration will commence.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">How Do You Price Your Projects?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">We pride ourselves on our complete financial transparency throughout each project. We will never withhold any financial information from our client.
This means you have access to every quote, every estimate, and every invoice at any time.</p><br>

	<p class="faqquestions">What is Your Warranty?</p>

	<p class="txtindent">By law we offer a warranty of 1 year on labour, 2 years on mechanical equipment, and 10 years structure. Any warranty on appliances will be provided by the manufacturers.
However, it is OUR policy to stand behind our products beyond their original warranty. This is why many of the products that we install exceed the state mandated warranty.
At the end of 1 year, we will do a walk through with the client and address any remaining pertinent issues.</p>
